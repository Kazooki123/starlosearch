# Tutorial
To get started with your Search Engine project, follow these steps to install the necessary extensions and dependencies:

# Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Change the current working directory to the location where you want to clone the Search Engine project.
Use the following command to clone the repository:
bash
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Kazooki123/starlosearch.git
```

# Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional)
If you plan to use the Python portion of the project, you can set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
 Change the directory to the project folder:
```bash
cd search-engine
```

Create a virtual environment:
```python
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
 On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

# Step 3: Install Dependencies (Optional)
If you set up a virtual environment, with it activated, install the required Python dependencies:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 4: Run the Search Engine
In the terminal, navigate to the project folder where your index.html, style.css, and script.js files are located.
Use a local server to run the Search Engine. You can use the http-server package, which is easy to set up:
If you don't have http-server installed, you can install it globally using npm:
```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

Start the server:
```bash
http-server
```

3.Once the server is running, open your web browser.

4.Go to `http://localhost:8080` or the appropriate address displayed in the terminal.
That's it! You have successfully set up and run your Search Engine project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Happy coding! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
