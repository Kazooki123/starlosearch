## Security Features

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

Ensure that your search engine has robust authentication and authorization mechanisms in place. Use secure authentication methods and enforce proper access controls to protect sensitive data and functionalities.

### 2. Input Validation

Implement thorough input validation to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other injection attacks. Validate and sanitize user input to mitigate the risk of malicious input.

### 3. Secure Communication

Enforce the use of secure communication channels, such as HTTPS, to encrypt data in transit. This helps protect user data from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 4. Regular Security Audits

Perform regular security audits and code reviews to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities in your codebase. Utilize static analysis tools and manual reviews to ensure the robustness of your search engine.

### 5. Keep Dependencies Updated

Regularly update and patch third-party dependencies to address known vulnerabilities. Use package management tools to track and update dependencies efficiently.

### 6. Logging and Monitoring

Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents promptly. Monitor system logs for suspicious activities and set up alerts to notify administrators of potential security breaches.
