# NOTE:

Web scraping would be a feature for StarloSearch sooner if
we decided to ditch off the Google Costume Search API. For such a
web scraper, there are few Python packages that'll be used such as (1) Pandas (2) ChromaDB (3) BeautifulSoup4 (4)
Pinecone, etc.

## Functions:

The web scraper function well likely uses either Pinecone or ChromaDB, this is because such a vector database can do
multitasking to search an accurate ranking
of a word, result, image & videos using various APIs as such.

## Well it be a feature for starlosearch?

That depends! For now, the search engine relies on the Google Costume Search API,
which is a great API tool for a simple search engine like StarloSearch, but if StarloSearch does become popular,
and it's rapidly becoming demanding, then we'll probably use a web scraper and a database that we can scale up to.
