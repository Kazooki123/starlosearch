# SPACE AI ðŸš€ðŸŒ‘

SpaceAI is a multi-model project by Kazooki123, creator of the StarloSearch engine: github.com/Kazooki123/starlosearch and few other projects that will be released sooner.

SpaceAI uses the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 to experiment, test and even fine tune its response given by the users prompt.

Not only that SpaceAI also uses the stable-diffusion-v1-5 for starvision, an AI image generation model for generating, analyzing or classifying images, other features like "image-to-text" as well!

And many more!
