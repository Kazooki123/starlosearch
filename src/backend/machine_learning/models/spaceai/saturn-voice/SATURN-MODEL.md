# PROJECT SATURN

### A voice clone project by Kazooki123

Project Saturn is one of the family projects called "Project Star."
Created and planned by a highschool student. Project Saturn is a project for A.I. voice cloning model. Using Python,
I will eventually try and progress such an ambitious project even for a highschool student like who suffers a bunch of
academic problems. But let's move on from that and start focusing on what well Project Saturn do!

## What's that?

It will be trained by a bunch of voices and text scripts to monitor, analyze and train its performance. Voices from
fictional characters, fictional
movies, or TV show characters well be included!
