## Why is the machine learning directory in a Search engine project?

Well, it may seem odd or weird for most or some.
The reason is I want it to be also integrated in my search engine (**except**: _voice-cloning & _image generation_.)
Something like a simple chatbot model well be cool in a search engine homepage so that users well feel some attraction_
with StarloSearch or even the A.I. model itself if necessary.

## Well the directory be moved out?

If so, **yes** its possible, but for now I'm still deciding whether or not it will have its on GitHub repo :p
